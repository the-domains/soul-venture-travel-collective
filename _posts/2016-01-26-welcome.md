# Welcome. 

Soul Venture, Travel Collective is for anyone on the journey, who is seeking connection, support and encouragement on their path.

Breathwork is an amazing modality for clearing out old emotions and traumas, and releasing stress and chronic disease from the body. The work I do is to support people to develop a healthier and deeper connection to life, and to integrate that in a way that improves the quality of their breath, health and relationships to self and others. 

I look forward to sharing this part of the journey with you. If you would like more information, or to be kept up to date with anything, Breathwork, Writing, Soul Travel related, or just want to find out more about me, my journey and method, please get in touch below, I would love to connect with you!  

With Love and best wishes, 

Peter Nathaniel Lee
